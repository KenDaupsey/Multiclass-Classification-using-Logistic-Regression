# Multiclass-Classification-using-Logistic-Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on multiclass classification using logistic regression. The project involves the exploration and implementation of logistic regression for classifying instances into multiple categories based on a given set of features. The project aims to provide insights into the process of setting up and implementing multiclass classification tasks using logistic regression, along with the necessary preprocessing steps and performance evaluation techniques.

## Description
This project focuses on multiclass classification using logistic regression, a commonly used machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. The project involves loading a dataset containing various features and a target variable representing different health statuses. The dataset is preprocessed, features are selected, and logistic regression is trained on the training data. The trained model is then evaluated using the testing data, and performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are computed. Finally, the project concludes with the visualization of the confusion matrix to provide insights into the model's performance.

## Summary
### Overview
This project delves into the realm of multiclass classification using logistic regression, a fundamental machine-learning technique. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of classifying instances into multiple health statuses based on a set of features.

### Methodology
The project begins with the exploration and preprocessing of the dataset, followed by the selection of relevant features and the creation of training and testing datasets. Logistic regression is then implemented using a pipeline that includes feature scaling and one-hot encoding for categorical variables. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Additionally, the confusion matrix is visualized to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

### Results
The logistic regression model demonstrates promising performance in classifying health statuses based on the provided features. The accuracy achieved on the testing dataset reflects the model's ability to make accurate predictions across multiple classes. Furthermore, the detailed analysis provided by the classification report and confusion matrix offers valuable insights into the model's strengths and areas for improvement. Overall, this project serves as a practical demonstration of implementing multiclass classification tasks using logistic regression and highlights the importance of thorough preprocessing and model evaluation techniques.
